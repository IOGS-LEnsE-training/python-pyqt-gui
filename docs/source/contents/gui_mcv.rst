MVC Approach to GUI Development
===============================

The **Model–View–Controller** (MVC) architecture is a software design pattern used to separate an application into three interconnected components: the **Model**, the **View**, and the **Controller**. This separation helps organize code, improve maintainability, and facilitate collaborative development, especially in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

Model
-----

The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the application’s state, processing information, and enforcing rules. The Model is completely independent from the user interface, meaning it can be reused or tested without relying on the View or Controller.

View
----

The View corresponds to the presentation layer—what the user actually sees and interacts with on the screen. It displays data from the Model and updates automatically when the Model changes. However, the View does not contain any business logic; it only focuses on the visual representation.

Controller
----------
The Controller acts as an intermediary between the user and the system. It handles user input (such as clicks or keyboard actions), interprets it, and updates the Model or the View accordingly. The Controller ensures that user actions produce the intended effects within the application.

Method
------

In practice, developing a GUI using the MVC pattern involves:

- Designing the Model to define how data is structured and manipulated.
- Creating the View to display this data in a clear and responsive way.
- Implementing the Controller to interpret user interactions and coordinate changes between the Model and the View.

By following the MVC approach, developers achieve a clean separation of concerns, making the GUI easier to test, extend, and maintain over time.
